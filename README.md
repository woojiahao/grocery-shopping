# grocery-shopping

You have been tasked to go grocery shopping for the week.

Inside `shopping-list.md`, you will find your shopping list items. As you walk around the grocery shop, you remove items from the shopping list that you found. You also notice that your shopping list is missing several things that you cannot find in the current grocery store, so you start adding to the shopping list.

## Goal

Edit `shopping-list.md` and remove at least one item from the shopping list and add at least one new item to the shopping list.

## Submission

To submit your progress, run the `submit.sh` script found in this repository:

```bash
bash submit.sh
```
